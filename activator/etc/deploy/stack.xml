<!--
    Configure location of application.properties for spring app deployed at /stack.

    You can also add 'docBase="/var/kgrid/activator-1.0.23.war' to the <Context>
    element if you are externalizing the war file deployment as well. If docBase is a
    symbolic link a restart is required to redeploy. Otherwise, changes to the .war file
    or this context.xml will reload the app.

    Other resources and enviroment variables can be set here, too.

    Copy this file to $CATALINA_BASE/conf/[enginename]/[hostname]/$APP.xml e.g.
    /opt/tomcat/conf/Catalina/localhost/stack.xml
